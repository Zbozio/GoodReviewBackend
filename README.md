Backend of the Book Recommendation Application

This repository contains the backend code for the book recommendation application, which is part of my engineering project. The backend is developed using C# and ASP.NET Core. It handles user management, processes book data, and generates personalized recommendations.

Features:
Recommendation Algorithms:

Cosine Similarity: Calculates the similarity between books based on their feature vectors (such as genre, author, etc.).

Collaborative Filtering (Author-based): Uses collaborative filtering to recommend books based on the user's preferences and historical ratings.
User Authentication and Authorization:

The backend implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and authorization.
Database:

Data is stored in an SQL Server database, managed through SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
The backend supports efficient data retrieval and interaction with the database to store user information, book data, and ratings.
Technologies Used:
C# (Programming Language)
ASP.NET Core (Framework)
SQL Server (Database)
JWT (JSON Web Tokens for Authentication)
Cosine Similarity & Author-based Collaborative Filtering (Recommendation Algorithms)
